## Introduction

This repository contains a Go-based API that demonstrates best practices in building RESTful services. The API is designed to be modular, easy to extend, and well-documented, making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to build their own APIs in Go.

## Features

- RESTful API: Follows REST principles for clean and predictable endpoints.

- Modular Design: Easy to extend and modify with a well-organized codebase.

- Database Integration: Supports integration with popular databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

- Authentication: Includes JWT-based authentication for secure access.

- Validation: Input validation to ensure data integrity.

- Logging: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring.

- Testing: Includes unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability.

## Installation

To get started with this API, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository:

```bash
    Copy

    git clone https://github.com/waseemofficial/API-golang.git
    cd API-golang
```

### Install Dependencies:
    Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
   
    go mod download
```
    Configure Environment Variables:

    Create a .env file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables. You can use the .env.example file as a template.

    Run the Application:
    Start the API server by running:

```bash

    go run main.go
```
Access the API:
    The API should now be running on http://localhost:8080. You can interact with it using tools like Postman or cURL.

## Usage

Once the API is up and running, you can start making requests to the available endpoints. Below are some examples of how to use the API:
Example Request: Create a New User

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}'
```
Example Request: Authenticate a User

```bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}'
```

## API Endpoints

Here are some of the key endpoints available in this API:

    - Users:

        - POST /api/users - Create a new user.

        - GET /api/users/{id} - Get a user by ID.

        - PUT /api/users/{id} - Update a user by ID.

        - DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete a user by ID.

    - Authentication:

        - POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.

        - POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user.

    - Posts:

        - GET /api/posts - Get all posts.

        - POST /api/posts - Create a new post.

        - GET /api/posts/{id} - Get a post by ID.

        - PUT /api/posts/{id} - Update a post by ID.

        - DELETE /api/posts/{id} - Delete a post by ID.

For a complete list of endpoints and their details, refer to the API Documentation.
